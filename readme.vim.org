A custom text object for selecting julia blocks.

Depends on vimscript #2100, which provides a framework for creating custom
text objects, and on julia-vim (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-vim).

Also requires that matchit.vim vimscript #39 is enabled.

# Usage #

When textobj-juliablock is installed you will gain two new text objects, which
are triggered by `aj` and `ij` respectively. These follow Vim convention, so
that `aj` selects _all_ of a julia block, and `ij` selects the _inner_ portion
of a julia block.

In julia, a block is always closed with the `end` keyword. Julia blocks may be
opened using one of several keywords, including `module`, `type`, `function`,
`if` and `for`. This example demonstrates a few of these:

    module Foo
    function Bar()
      for i in 1:3
        println(i)
      end
    end
    end

Suppose your cursor was positioned on the word `function`. Typing `vaj` would
enable visual mode selecting _all_ of the method definition. Your selection
would comprise the following lines:

    function Bar()
      for i in 1:3
        println(i)
      end
    end

Whereas if you typed `vij`, you would select everything _inside_ of the method
definition, which looks like this:

    for i in 1:3
      println(i)
    end

Note that the `aj` and `ij` text objects always enable _visual line_ mode,
even if you were in visual character or block mode before you triggered the
juliab lock text object.

Note too that the `aj` and `ij` text objects always position your cursor on
the `end` keyword. If you want to move to the top of the selection, you can do
so with the `o` key.

# Limitations #

Some text objects in Vim respond to a count. For example, the `a{` text object
will select _all_ of the current `{}` delimited block, but if you prefix it
with the number 2 (e.g. `v2i{`) then it will select all of the block that
contains the current block. The julia block text object does not respond in this
way if you prefix a count. This is due to a limitation in vimscript #2100.

However, you can achieve a similar effect by repeating the julia block
text-object manually. So if you press `vaj` to select the current julia block,
you can expand your selection outwards by repeating `aj`, or contract your
selection inwards by repeating `ij`.

# Installation #

First of all, ensure that you have installed vimscript #2100, and julia-vim
(https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia-vim) without which this plugin will not
work.

Then, ensure that you have enabled the matchit.vim vimscript #39 plugin. This
can be achieved by running (or placing this in your vimrc file):

    :runtime macros/matchit.vim

Finally, you need to ensure that Vim is not running in vi-compatiable mode, and
that filetype plugins are enabled. Placing these lines in your vimrc file will
set up this configuration for you:

    set nocompatible
    if has("autocmd")
      filetype indent plugin on
    endif

This plugin is distributed as a vimball, so to install it you just need to
open the file with Vim and run the command:

    :source %

If you prefer to manage your plugins using pathogen (vimscript #2332), or
Vundle, or any other plugin manager, then you might prefer to checkout the
latest versions directly from github:
